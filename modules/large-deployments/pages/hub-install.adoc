= Hub Installation

Before you begin, you need to install the XMLRPC API package, and configure the Hub Server to use the API.



.Procedure: Installing and Configuring the XMLRPC API
. On the Hub Server or on a host that has access to all Servers' XMLRPC APIs, install the ``hub-xmlrpc-api`` package.
The package is available in the {productname} {version} repositories.
. Verify if the configuration file available at  ``/etc/hub/hub-xmlrpc-api-config.json`` is pointing to correct hub instance and modify if needed.

. In addition to that , there are 2 more timeout parameters (`connect_timeout` & `read_write_timeout`) are defined in this configuration file. Values for these parameters are defined in seconds.
. A restart of service is needed to reflect any changes in configuration file.
